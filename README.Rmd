## <a id='about'></a>1. About 
scrape_PMC.py and it's cousin scrape_PMC.r are a set of functions to retrieve PMC ids, download article metadata, figures, and pdfs, given a valid searchterm.
The python implementation (python3) is a command line program accepting arguments to limit the search and control output.
Note that NCBI explicitly prohibits paralell requests when using their services so please do not abuse their servers.
You may also consider running the program after hours if your id list is long.
 This tool isn't perfect and is bound to miss things, especially older articles where the formatting of the pmc html is different.
 Suggestions for improvements to the flexibility of the scrape are welcomed.
